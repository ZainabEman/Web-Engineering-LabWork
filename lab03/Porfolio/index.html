            <h1>Salam, I am Zainab😁</h1>
            <p>Zainab is a software engineer by day 👩‍💻, a student by night 📚, and a professional napper in between 😴.
                Her coding skills are as sharp as her ability to find the best snacks 🍫 while debugging (which, for some
                 reason, always involves chocolate). She has a PhD in <span>"Procrastination"</span> and a master's degree in <span>"Sleep Optimization"</span>
                  🛌. When she’s not typing away at her laptop 💻 or attending online classes 🎓, she’s plotting her next big adventure
                   ✈️—usually involving a plane ticket, a suitcase 🧳, and a whole lot of snacks for the journey 🍿. And if you catch her
                    eating 🍕, sleeping 🛏️, or traveling 🌍, you can bet she’ll be doing at least two of those things at once!</p>
